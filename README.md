# C/C++ - 2D 2-Player Fighting Game

### Preview :
Soon

### Description :
This fighting game is a revamp passion project I recently started based on my GCSE Computer Science coursework where I created the same concept using Python's Pygame library. The reason for choosing to revamp my old Pygame project was due to the fact I have grown a lot as a programmer over the years and after looking back at the code I found many issues with it e.g. incorrect use of OOP techniques such as classes and hard to understand code due to all the code being lumped into one file. Therefore, I decided that I would create a polished version using my old code as the foundation to test my knowledge C/C++ due with it being faster than Python, the SDL2 library used with C/C++ has well-designed docummentation as well as giving the chance to created a larger scaled project in the language.

### Technologies used :
    - C/C++
    - SDL2
    - SDL2/Image
